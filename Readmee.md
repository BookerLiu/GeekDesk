Free / beautiful / highly customized is the need and direction since the birth of GeekDesk, and will develop in these directions in the future

At present, GeekDesk is only developed by one person, so the ideas are limited, and you can also raise issues if you have good suggestions

In addition, if you like GeekDesk, you may be able to buy anti-exfoliation shampoo for the author
Of course, ordering a Star is also an incentive for the author~ 😊😊😊
